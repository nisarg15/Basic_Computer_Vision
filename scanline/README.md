# Q) Plot the R, G, and B values along the scanline on the 250th row of the image.
# A) First separate the RGB channel from the image and take the intensity values of the 250 row. Then we take the x-axis as the number of columns and the y-axis determines the intensity value at each particular column of the 250 row. Here the intensity of the 3 channels are represented with 3 colors.

# Output
